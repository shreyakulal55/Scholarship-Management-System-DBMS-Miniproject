# Scholarship-Management-System-DBMS-Miniproject

Scholarship Management System

This project  was created using NetBeans, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development and developed using Java and MySQL, offers a user-friendly interface built with Swing. Faculty members can manage scholarship-related tasks, such as adding, deleting, updating, and viewing scholarship and agency details. Additionally, they can access student information and monitor application statuses.

Students, on the other hand, benefit from the system by having access to a centralized platform where they can view available scholarships and update their application statuses. This enhances 
communication between students and faculty members, ultimately improving the scholarship application process.
